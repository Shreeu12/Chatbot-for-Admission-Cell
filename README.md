# Chatbot-for-Admission-Cell
  This project is focusing on creating a chatbot to be used by students to get their queries responded easily from the college website.The AI Chatbot for Admission Cell has the capacity to make friendly conversations; respond the course and faculty details; give the link for the academic calendar; answer the frequently asked questions; calculate the fees based on the student's input; and give the timings, address, contacts, and events information of the departments. To build the chatbot, Machine Learning Algorithm used.
  Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future.Â Support vector machines (SVMs) can be used in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including dialog agents, natural language dialog systems, and natural language understanding (NLU) modules.
